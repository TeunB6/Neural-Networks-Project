# Neural-Networks-Project
This Repository contains the Semester project for the Neural Networks of Teun Boersma, Phillip Rode, Robert Hielkema and Alexia Zaharie. The practice directory contains a basic RNN, running and training script for the prediction of a sentence. For the final project we have created a RNN for the generation of classical music by Mozart. To do so we have created ... We trained the hyperparameters and varied the architecture using ... The final product can be run using ... Where a random initialization is used to jumpstart the network.
