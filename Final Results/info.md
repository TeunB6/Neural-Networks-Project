This folder contains the final results of our project. If you wish to run the final model its name is 'final'. The sound files here contain the predictions from our model starting at different points in the time sequence. Intuitively 'start' starts at the start around time step 10 of our processed time series, 'middle' starts around 300 and 'end' starts at the end of the sequence. In the paper only 'end' is discussed.
